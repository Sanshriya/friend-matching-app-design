# Product Design for a Friend Matching App

This repository contains a product design project based on my concept for a friend-matching mobile app. The document outlines the design process, including stakeholder identification, user personas, user stories, storyboards, screen designs, prototypes, and a cognitive walkthrough used to evaluate usability and suggest improvements.
